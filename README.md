# 75-Mark AQA A-Level Computer Science NEA

This is my full-mark (75/75) coursework submission for the 2024 AQA A-Level Computer Science NEA. The write-up can be found in `NEA Write Up.docx`, while the code is located in the `Coursework` folder. The project is developed using VB.NET, featuring a Windows Forms application.

## Project Overview

My project is a maze generation and pathfinding tool that includes:

### Pathfinding Algorithms:

1.  Depth-First Search (DFS)
2.  Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3.  Greedy Best-First Search
4.  A* Search

### Maze Generation Algorithms:

1.  Kruskal's Algorithm
2.  Prim's Algorithm
3.  Recursive Backtracker
4.  Recursive Division
5.  Binary Tree

The application visualizes these algorithms in real time, with a slider to control the speed of the generation process. The grid size is fully customizable, and there is an option to manually draw your own grid and adjust the start and end points.

### Features:

-   **Algorithm Metrics**: The tool records key performance metrics for both pathfinding and maze generation, such as:
    -   Pathfinding: Time taken, shortest path, and number of cells explored.
    -   Maze Generation: Time taken, percentage of dead ends, percentage of branches, and average corridor length.
-   **Grid Export**: You can export the generated grids, which is especially useful for larger grids (e.g., over 600x600) to view them in high resolution.
